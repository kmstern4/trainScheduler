### About
This app was built as an assignment during my bootcamp. It uses Firebase to store information on fake trains and then dynamically display that information in the browswer. Users can uploat a train by providing the name, destination, first arrival time, and frequency. The "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" columns are then calculated and converted using Moment.js. Trains can also be removed using the "Remove" button to the right of the row. The data for that train is deleted from Firebase and the entire table is re-printed dynamically from the updated database.
